# This code defines functions ask_question and main. The ask_question function takes a question,
#  answer choices, and the correct answer as input and displays them to the user. It then checks 
# if the user's answer matches the correct answer (converted to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison).
#  The main function defines a list of questions with answer choices and the correct answer. 
# It iterates through the questions, calls ask_question for each one, and keeps track of the score. 
# Finally, it prints the user's score.
