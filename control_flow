# Control Flow: conditional statements(if-else) and loops(for, while).Make deciions and repeat tasks based on conditions.

# Control flow helps in making decisions and alter the programs excution based on certain conditions eg if-else statement

# if-else statement: 
# the if-else statement evaluates a condition, if the condition is True, the code indented below the if statement executes.
# if the condition is false, the code indented below the else statement (if present) executes

# Example

from msilib import sequence


age = 20

if age <= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligilble to vote.")


if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote")
else:
    print("you are   not eligible to vote")

# elif statement:
# Use to chain multiple conditions. Checks for alternative conditions if the initial if condition fails

# Example

name =" Ann"
age = 15

if age >= 18:
    print(name, "is eligible to vote.")
elif age >= 13:
    print(name, "is a teenager.")
else:
    print(name, "is a child")


# Loops
# Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. loop constructors are "for" and "while"

# for loop: A for loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string or range) and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.
#  Syntax:
#for item in sequence:
    # code to be executed

# Example 1

fruits = ["apples", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)


# Example 2 with range

for i in range(5):
    print(i)


# While Loops

# A while loop repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a given condition is true
#  Syntax:
#   while condition:
      # code to be executes

count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1


# Loop Control Statements
#  1. break: Terminates the loop entirely
#  2. continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next

# Example:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    if num == 3:
        break
    print(num)


# Nested Loops
# loops can be next within each other

# Example

for i in range(3):
    for j in range(4):
        print(i, j)
